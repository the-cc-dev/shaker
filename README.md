Additionally, this module can be built using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/). Besides running the tests, Grunt also analyses the code using [JSHint](http://www.jshint.com/). To run Grunt, go to the folder where you have installed password and run `grunt`. You need to have [grunt-cli](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-cli) installed.
