# password

password hashes and verifies passwords in a cryptographically secure way.

## Installation

At the moment, installation of this module must be made manually.

## Quick start

The first thing you need to do is to integrate password into your application. For that add a reference to the `password` module.

```javascript
var password = require('password');
```

### Hashing passwords

To hash a password call the `generate` function and specify the password as well as a callback. The callback gets a randomly chosen salt and the hash that was calculated using the password and this salt.

```javascript
password.generate('secret', function (salt, hash) {
  // ...
});
```

### Verifying passwords

To verify a password entered by the user you need the salt and the hash that were generated by the `generate` function. Using these values call the `verify` function and additionally provide a callback that receives whether the password could be successfully verified or not.

```javascript
password.verify('secret', salt, hash, function (verified) {
  // ...
});
```

Please note that verifying artificially delays calling the callback for 250ms. This is to avoid brute force attacks by automatically guessing and trying random passwords.

## Running the tests

password has been developed using TDD. To run the tests, go to the folder where you have installed password to and run `npm test`. You need to have [mocha](https://github.com/visionmedia/mocha) installed.

    $ npm test

Additionally, this module can be built using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/). Besides running the tests, Grunt also analyses the code using [JSHint](http://www.jshint.com/). To run Grunt, go to the folder where you have installed password and run `grunt`. You need to have [grunt-cli](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-cli) installed.

    $ grunt
